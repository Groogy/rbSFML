This is the Ruby bindings of the SFML2 library developed and maintained by Groogy
and Trickster. 

I hope you enjoy using rbSFML. If you make anything in it then we are very interested
in hearing about it. We can always be reached at http://www.sfml-dev.org/forum for 
support, ideas or just have a nice chat.

Of course this means this library depends on SFML2 so you'll have to install
SFML2 on your development machine in order to compile rbSFML. 

NOTE for Windows users: Currently you'll have to place SFML2 include headers and static library
files in the root folder of the rbSFML library in Windows for it to find them. 
Hopefully this will be fixed.
