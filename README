This is the Ruby bindings of the SFML2 library developed and maintained by Groogy
and Trickster. 

I hope you enjoy using rbSFML. If you make anything in it then we are very interested
in hearing about it. We can always be reached at http://www.sfml-dev.org/forum for 
support, ideas or just have a nice chat.

#    DEPENDENCIES     #
#######################
Of course this means this library depends on SFML2 so you'll have to install
SFML2 on your development machine in order to compile rbSFML. 

NOTE for Windows users: Currently you'll have to place SFML2 include headers and static library
files in sub-folder of the rbSFML library in Windows for it to find them. 
Hopefully this will be fixed. Place the SFML include folder in a folder called "includes"
and the static libraries in a folder called "libs".

This library also of course depends in a proper Ruby installation and rake.
The library was created using Ruby-1.9.2 but it might work with lower versions too.

Recommended is this setup:
	* SFML2 - Latest revision
	* Ruby-1.9.2p136
	* Rake, version 0.8.7

#       INSTALL       #
#######################
Open up your choice of command-line terminal. Navigate to the folder where you have 
placed the rbSFML source. From here you can run different commands depending on what you
want to do. 

	* rake
		- This command just simply builds all the different modules
	* rake install
		- This command will build the modules and copy them to your ruby folder
		  Not for Windows users: If you got Vista or higher this operation might fail
		  depending on your settings for adminstrators and where you actually placed your
		  ruby installation. The path to place it manually is: 
		  <pathto>/ruby192/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/i386-msvcrt/sfml/
		  The last folder "sfml" is probably one you'll have to create manually.
	* rake rdoc
		- Builds the rdoc documentation of the library.
